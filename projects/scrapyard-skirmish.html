            <p class="ProjectParagraphPrimary">Scrapyard Skirmish is a 4-player, team-based, strategy game for tablet devices. Team members must work together to place their units on the board in a strategic manner to raid their opponents' scrap pile while also defending their own. They then ready up and watch the battle commence.</p>

            <p class="ProjectParagraphPrimary" style="padding-bottom: 20px;">Development for Scrapyard Skirmish started in September of 2017 and took place over a seven month period by a team of 13 people. It was then presented to the public at the annual Fuse show at the Peoria Riverfront Museum in April. I came onto the project in January of 2018 assigned to network programming with no prior experience. I immediately started researching the best route for us. I then quickly learned how to use a MySQL database along with PHP to interface with the C# in Unity. We used this to send back and forth unit placement information along with readying up information.</p>
