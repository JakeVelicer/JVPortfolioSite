            <p class="ProjectParagraphPrimary">I started working on season ones of The Pit in the fall of 2024. Our approach to this show was a bit different than other shows. We worked together with the show and decided on building a general kit of several apps, each one specializing in the various types of things you would see on a computer screen in a Hospital. This consisted of an On Call Board app, Patient Charting Pages app, Meds Order Page app, and a couple more. The idea was to build these apps to be general purpose enough so that they could be used throughout the entire season and updated with new functionality as needed. If a shot called for something more specialized, I would code a graphic with the functionality just needed for that shot as usual. This was all done in Unity.</p>

            <h2>Patient Charting Pages App</h2>
            <p class="ProjectParagraphPrimary">In this app the user can pretend to be charting information on the patient as they talk to them in different categories. The text they type can be predetermined by the technician on set. That way the talent can hit any key and the correct text will always be typed out. The app could also be set to type in Free mode. While we had a lot of this functionality in our codebase before starting the show, I implemented the ability for the predetermined text to be configured in the app itself as well as that and other settings to be saved/loaded.</p>
            <h2>Meds Order Screen App</h2>
            <p class="ProjectParagraphPrimary">This was, what I thought as, the most interesting app to work on for the show. It is a realistic looking meds ordering screen where the doctor can select the various medications from the different categories needed for the patient and then “order them”. They can select them manually, or they can be selected in a predetermined order. I worked on this app in conjunction with our CTO Chris Cundey. This app was designed to take in a text document which contained a list of medication descriptions with values assigned to each of them. The medications were approved by a doctor on set for realism. I implemented the UI layout and functionality for instantiating the various categories that could take in the information. Chris implemented the parsing of the text document functionality. Later as a request from set I implemented a panel so the technician can input values for which medications will be auto selected in the correct order by the talent. Before we had to update the app each time.</p>
            <h2>Updates to The Vitals App</h2>
            <p class="ProjectParagraphPrimary">MMP has an app made in Unity that has been used for multiple shows called Vitals. It is an app designed to imitate everything that an EKG machine would do. All the settings and cues are to be configured in the app itself.  While I did not work at MMP during its initial development I have been assigned to be its caretaker in many ways since working there. This has included fixing bugs and implementing new functionality when needed.</p>
            <p class="ProjectParagraphPrimary">For The Pit, this mainly involved implementing new waveforms for the heart rate and blood pressure. These waveforms had to be approved by a doctor on set for accuracy, so sometimes we did multiple iterations. Some waveforms were easier than others. This involved adding the ability for them to be selected in the UI as well as playing with values to get it to look right at different rates when being drawn on the graph. I also added additional settings for the app during season one's runtime such as the ability for the app to start on the first cue, start flatlined, or start from the last cue used.</p>
