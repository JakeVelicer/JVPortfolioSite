            <p class="ProjectParagraphPrimary">During my internship at F84 Games in Los Angeles, I had the pleasure of working on some bigger IPs. Aquaman: Race to Atlantis was the game that I was able to get the most hands on design experience while there. I was assigned to do additional level design on the first wave by placing enemies, coins, power-ups, and obstacles in different scenarios. I was then also tasked with testing and refining other waves with my coworker as well as the waves we worked on individually. My work was accepted and shipped in the final product.</p>
