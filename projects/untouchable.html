            <p class="ProjectParagraphPrimary">Untouchable is a sci-fi themed 3D platforming runner. Players must run from the moving laser wall by jumping from platform to platform to survive. Players must also dodge appearing obstacles by weaving around them or by rotating the tunnel of platforms. By nearly missing obstacles, the player slowly charges their invisibility power up so that they can be UNTOUCHABLE for a brief period of time.</p>

            <p class="ProjectParagraphPrimary">Development on Untouchable started in November 2019 and ended in December. The game was made in Unity for a class focused on rapid prototyping. As such, the goal of this prototype was to test how fun the main mechanics could be, specifically the effect of the rotating walls on gameplay situations. We made one level to test the different obstacles that could be dodged and how they worked with each other. I was a programmer on the project. I was tasked with making the wall rotation mechanic, the obstacle spawning system, and some of the obstacles such as the shocking platform. We wanted to go for that “I'll just play one more run” feel, and I think we achieved it.</p>
